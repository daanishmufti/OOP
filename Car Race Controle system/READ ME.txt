EXTERNAL Libraries:

. conio.h  to use getch()  in line number 82    input = getch();     used to get user input without pressing enter

. cstdlib  to use system("CLS")  in line number 135   system("CLS");     used to clear screen

Code eplanation:

. Utilising structure called car with two varaibles position, points as integers

. Utilising structure called track containning call to two instances of car structure and definning a constant variabe called lenght initialised to zero

. Display Function (void data type) used to display track along with the position of the cars
  -this function uses for loop to display track and car position

. Menu Function (void data type) used to display user the controls

. Main Fucntion

-structure called daanish is created and its variables are initialised to zero

-a while loop used to prompt user a option to exit

-series of if and else statements used to run code based of the user's input 

. for the car going out of bounds or above 30 spaces / below 0 spaces ,the code is initialised to highest or lowest psoition in track by incrementing or decrementing positon. e.g

if(input == 'd') // d key pressed 
		{
			if(daanish.car1.position >= 30) // if car goes out of bounds meaning above 30 horizontal spaces , rest to 0
			{
				daanish.car1.position = 0;
				++daanish.car1.points; 
			}
			else
			{
				++daanish.car1.position; // increment the postion
			}
		}
